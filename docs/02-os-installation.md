# Step 2: OS Installation

## üéØ Goal
Install Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS on your mini PC with proper storage configuration for your home lab setup.

## üêß Why Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS?
- **Long Term Support**: Updates until 2027
- **Excellent hardware support**: Works great with AMD Ryzen mini PCs
- **Docker friendly**: Native Docker support
- **Large community**: Tons of tutorials and help available
- **Stable**: Perfect for 24/7 home server operation

## üì• Download Ubuntu Server

**Note**: Do this on your Windows PC/laptop, not the mini PC

### Get the ISO
```bash
# Download via browser (easiest on Windows):
# Go to: https://ubuntu.com/download/server
# Download: ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso

# Or using PowerShell:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso" -OutFile "ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso"
```

### Create Installation Media

**Use your Windows PC to create the USB installer**

#### Recommended: Rufus (Windows)
1. **Download Rufus**: https://rufus.ie/
2. **Insert USB drive** (8GB+, will be erased)
3. **Open Rufus**:
    - Device: Select your USB drive
    - Boot selection: SELECT the Ubuntu ISO file
    - Partition scheme: GPT
    - Target system: UEFI
4. **Click START** and wait for completion

#### Alternative: Balena Etcher
1. **Download Etcher**: https://www.balena.io/etcher/
2. **Select Ubuntu ISO**
3. **Select USB drive**
4. **Flash** and wait

#### Alternative: Windows PowerShell (Advanced)
```powershell
# List available disks
Get-Disk

# Use Windows built-in tool (replace X: with your USB drive letter)
# This is more complex - Rufus is recommended for Windows users
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Temporary Setup for Installation

**You'll need these items temporarily for the initial installation:**

### Required for Installation
- **USB Keyboard**: Any USB keyboard for setup
- **Monitor/TV**: HDMI monitor or TV with HDMI input
- **HDMI Cable**: To connect mini PC to screen
- **USB Drive**: With Ubuntu Server installer (created above)

### After Installation
- **Remove**: Keyboard, monitor, HDMI cable (won't need them anymore)
- **Keep connected**: Ethernet cable, power, UPS
- **Access**: Everything via SSH from your main PC/laptop

## üñ•Ô∏è BIOS/UEFI Setup

### Boot Settings
1. **Power on** mini PC with USB drive inserted
2. **Enter BIOS**: Usually F2, F12, or Del during boot
3. **Boot order**: Set USB drive as first boot device
4. **Secure Boot**: Disable if having issues (can re-enable later)
5. **UEFI mode**: Ensure UEFI (not Legacy) mode is selected

### Check Hardware Detection
- Verify 32GB RAM detected
- Confirm all SSDs visible (1TB NVMe + 512GB SATA)
- Check Ethernet connection

## üöÄ Installation Process

### 1. Boot from USB
- Select "Try or Install Ubuntu Server"
- Choose your language (English recommended for tutorials)

### 2. Initial Setup
- **Language**: English
- **Keyboard**: Your keyboard layout
- **Network**: Configure connections
    - **Ethernet**: Should auto-detect and connect
    - **WiFi**: Can configure during installation or later
    - Set static IP if you know your network setup
    - Or use DHCP for now (can change later)

### 3. Storage Configuration

This is the most important part for your setup!

#### Choose Manual Storage Layout
```
Select: "Custom storage layout"
Not: "Use entire disk" (we need specific partitioning)
```

#### Partition the 1TB NVMe SSD (Flexible Layout for Future Photo Management)
```
Device: /dev/nvme0n1 (1TB NVMe)

Smart partitioning for future flexibility:
1. EFI Boot: 1GB, fat32, /boot/efi
2. Boot: 1GB, ext4, /boot  
3. Root: 100GB, ext4, / (OS + system files)
4. Home: 200GB, ext4, /home (user files, small projects)
5. Docker: 100GB, ext4, /opt/docker (containers)
6. Photos: 400GB, ext4, /mnt/photos (future organized photos)
7. Projects: 150GB, ext4, /mnt/projects (development work)
8. Swap: 32GB (match your RAM)
```

**Why this layout?**
- **Smaller /home**: Just for user configs and small files
- **Dedicated /mnt/photos**: Large space ready for organized photos
- **Dedicated /mnt/projects**: Separate development workspace
- **Flexibility**: Can easily adjust usage without repartitioning

### 4. User Account Setup
```
Your name: Your Full Name
Your server's name: homelab-server (or your preference)
Pick a username: your-username
Choose a password: Strong password
Confirm your password: Same password
```

**Important**: This user will have sudo privileges

### 5. SSH Setup
```
‚úÖ Install OpenSSH server
‚úÖ Import SSH identity: No (we'll set up keys later)
```

### 6. Software Selection

#### Recommended Snaps
```
‚ùå Docker (we'll install manually for better control)
‚ùå Other snaps (install what you need later)
```

Keep it minimal - we'll install everything we need manually.

- **Development**: Your Java/Python projects will work great on Linux

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Boot Issues
- **GRUB not found**: Check UEFI boot order in BIOS
- **Kernel panic**: Try booting from USB again, check RAM seating

### Storage Issues
- **Mount failed**: Check /etc/fstab for correct device names
- **Permission denied**: Verify mount points exist and have correct permissions

### Network Issues
- **No connectivity**: Check cable, verify interface name in netplan
- **DNS not working**: Verify nameservers in netplan configuration

### SSH Issues
- **Connection refused**: Verify SSH service running: `sudo systemctl status ssh`
- **Permission denied**: Check username, password, verify SSH enabled during install

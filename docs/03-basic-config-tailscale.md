# Step 3: Basic System Configuration + Tailscale Setup

## üéØ Goal
Configure your Ubuntu server for secure remote access via Tailscale, then transition to headless operation (no keyboard/monitor needed).

## üìã Prerequisites & Account Setup

### Before Starting
- **Ubuntu Server installed** (Step 2 complete)
- **Keyboard/monitor still connected** (we'll disconnect them at the end)
- **Internet connection working** (Ethernet or WiFi)

### Create Tailscale Account (5 minutes)
**Do this first while your system updates:**

1. **Go to**: https://tailscale.com
2. **Click**: "Get started for free"
3. **Sign up options**:
    - **Email + Password** (create new account)
    - **Google account** (sign in with Google)
    - **GitHub account** (sign in with GitHub)
4. **Verify email** if using email signup
5. **Complete**: You'll see the Tailscale admin dashboard

### Account Benefits (Free Tier)
- **Up to 20 devices** for personal use
- **Unlimited traffic**
- **Full feature access**
- **No time limits**
- **No credit card required**

**Leave this browser tab open** - you'll need it for device authentication later.

## üöÄ System Updates First

### Update System Packages
```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Upgrade all packages
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install -y curl wget htop tree unzip

# Reboot if kernel was updated
sudo reboot
```

**Wait for reboot, then log back in**

## üîê Install & Configure Tailscale

### 1. Install Tailscale
```bash
# Download and run Tailscale installer
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# This installs Tailscale but doesn't connect it yet
```

### 2. Connect to Your Tailscale Account
```bash
# Start Tailscale and connect to your account
sudo tailscale up

# This will output a URL like:
# To authenticate, visit: https://login.tailscale.com/a/...
```

### 3. Authenticate (Two Options)

#### Option A: Use the URL (Easier)
1. **Copy the URL** from the terminal
2. **Open it on your Windows PC** browser
3. **Log in to your Tailscale account**
4. **Approve the device** connection

#### Option B: Use Auth Key (If URL doesn't work)
1. **On your Windows PC**: Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
2. **Generate an auth key** (one-time use)
3. **Back on server**: `sudo tailscale up --authkey=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

### 4. Verify Tailscale Connection
```bash
# Check Tailscale status
sudo tailscale status

# Get your Tailscale IP address
tailscale ip -4

# Enable Magic DNS for easier access
sudo tailscale up --accept-dns

# Check your hostname
hostname
```

**Example output:**
```bash
# Your stable IPs:
100.64.15.42    # Tailscale IPv4
fd7a:115c:a1e0::42  # Tailscale IPv6

# Your Magic DNS hostname:
homelab-server.tail-scale.ts.net
```

## üî• Configure UFW Firewall

### What is UFW?
**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** is Ubuntu's built-in security system that controls which network connections can reach your server. Think of it as a security guard that blocks unauthorized access.

### Basic Security Setup
```bash
# Allow SSH (port 22) - so you can remote control the server
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Allow Tailscale interface - so VPN traffic works properly
sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0

# Enable firewall protection
sudo ufw enable

# Check what's currently allowed
sudo ufw status verbose
```

### Web Server Access Options

**Choose based on your needs:**

#### Option A: Tailscale-Only Access (Recommended for Home Lab)
```bash
# Keep current rules - access web services through Tailscale VPN
# 
# Access methods:
# http://100.64.15.42:3000        # Direct IP + port
# https://100.64.15.42:443        # HTTPS works fine through Tailscale
# http://homelab-server:3000      # Magic DNS hostname (easier!)
# https://homelab-server:443      # HTTPS + Magic DNS

# Benefits:
# - Encrypted VPN tunnel + optional HTTPS
# - Easy hostnames instead of IP addresses
# - Access from anywhere with Tailscale
```

#### Option B: Public Web Access (If you want to share websites)
```bash
# Add web server ports to firewall
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp     # HTTP websites
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp    # HTTPS websites
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp   # Node.js apps (example)
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp   # Java/Tomcat apps (example)

# Check updated rules
sudo ufw status
```

**We'll start with Option A (Tailscale-only) for security. You can always add web ports later when you deploy services.**

## üåê Test Remote SSH Access

### Important: Internet vs Local SSH
- **Before Tailscale**: SSH only works from your home network (`ssh user@192.168.1.x`)
- **After Tailscale**: SSH works from anywhere on internet (`ssh user@100.64.x.x`)
- **Same user account**: The username/password you created during Ubuntu installation

### From Your Windows PC

#### Option 1: Install Tailscale on Windows (Recommended)
1. **Download Tailscale** from https://tailscale.com/download/windows
2. **Install and login** with your account
3. **Test SSH connection**:
```bash
# Replace with your server's Tailscale IP
ssh your-username@100.64.15.42
```

#### Option 2: Use Tailscale Web SSH (Backup)
1. **Go to**: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines
2. **Find your server** in the device list
3. **Click SSH** button to access via browser

### Verify Remote Access Works
```bash
# Test commands via SSH to make sure everything works
whoami
hostname
df -h
tailscale status
```

## üîë Set Up SSH Keys (Optional but Recommended)

### Generate SSH Keys on Windows PC
```powershell
# In PowerShell on your Windows PC
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# This creates keys in: C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\
```

### Copy Public Key to Server
```bash
# From your Windows PC, copy public key to server
scp C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub your-username@100.64.15.42:~/

# On the server, add the key
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
cat ~/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
rm ~/id_ed25519.pub

# Test passwordless login
exit
ssh your-username@100.64.15.42  # Should not ask for password
```

## üì± Install Tailscale on Your Phone (Bonus)

### Mobile Access
1. **Download Tailscale app** (iOS/Android)
2. **Login with your account**
3. **SSH from your phone** using apps like:
    - **Termius** (iOS/Android)
    - **JuiceSSH** (Android)
    - **Blink** (iOS)

## üéâ Transition to Headless Operation

### Final Tests Before Disconnecting
```bash
# 1. Verify SSH works from all your devices
# 2. Test basic server commands remotely
# 3. Confirm Tailscale IP is stable

# Check your Tailscale IP one more time
tailscale ip -4
# Remember this IP: 100.64.15.42 (example)
```

### Clean Up Physical Setup
**Now you can disconnect and store these items:**
- ‚ùå **USB Keyboard** (not needed anymore)
- ‚ùå **Monitor/TV** (not needed anymore)
- ‚ùå **HDMI Cable** (not needed anymore)

### Keep Connected
- ‚úÖ **Ethernet Cable** (primary internet)
- ‚úÖ **Power Cable** (to UPS)
- ‚úÖ **Old drives with photos** (for later consolidation)

## üîç Verify Headless Operation

### From Your Windows PC
```bash
# SSH to your server using Tailscale IP
ssh your-username@100.64.15.42

# Run some commands to verify everything works
htop          # Check system resources (press 'q' to quit)
df -h         # Check disk space
sudo systemctl status tailscaled  # Verify Tailscale is running
```

## üìã Tailscale Management

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check connection status
sudo tailscale status

# See your IPs
